      <description>I would like to say that this blog has been relaunched on Github using Hugo. But if something never launched in the first place I am not sure it can be relaunched. I initially had a WordPress blog on SiteGround. It never made it out of test. But I did learn a lot about deploying WordPress and the different plugins. It did come in handy when my work started using WordPress for the company site.</description>

      <title>Defining Measures in DAX Studio</title>

      <description>After a period of not defining measures in DAX Studio, I seem to make the same two mistakes.
The first error occurs when I try to run the following code to define a measure in a query:
DEFINE MEASURE [UnitPrice] = SUM(&#39;Sales&#39;[Unit Price])EVALUATECALCULATE([UnitPrice])This generates the following error: The syntax for &amp;lsquo;=&amp;rsquo; is incorrect. .
The issue lies in not including the table name before the measure name.</description>
